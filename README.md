# Keras-Sequential-Model-MNIST-Dataset

-Imported MNIST andwritten numbers dataset from Keras datasets
- Splitted Dataset into train and test data
- Visualized dataset
- Normalized data between 0 to 1 values for better fittin of model, as the array values ranged between 0-255 
- Built a Sequantial Model with input layer as shape 28x28, which is a shape of image in dataset
- Dense layer with 100 neurons and output layer with 10 as data raneged between 0 to 9 numbers
- Used activation fuctions 'relu' and 'softmax' and optimizer 'adam
- Trained the model with 5 epochs with accuracy more that 95%
- Evaluated the model with more that 97% accuracy.
